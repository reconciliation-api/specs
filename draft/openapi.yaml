            either `name` or `property`, depending on whether the condition relates to
            entity names or their properties.
        pid:
          description: |-
            a [property]: /property identifier, to be provided if and only if the match_type is property.

        v:
          description: |-
            one or more [property-value]: /property-value "property values". If `match_type` is `name`, then this value is to be matched to entity names, otherwise to the property values via the supplied [pid]. The specifics of how this similarity is defined are determined by the service.
        
        required:
          description: |-
            an optional boolean indicating if a match for the property is required for an
            entity to enter the list of candidates (i.e. acting like a filter or a WHERE
            clause in SQL) or optional (i.e. only effecting the entity's rank in the
            list of candidates)
        
        match_quantifier:
          description: |-
            An optional string to indicate which of the values in v to match.
            MUST be any (equivalent to boolean OR), all (equivalent to boolean AND),
            or none (equivalent to boolean NOT)
        
        match_qualifier:
          description: |-
            An optional string to indicate how to match the values in v.
            This can be used for general matching relations like "skos:exactMatch",
            "skos:closeMatch", etc. or for specific features like spatial matching
            with geo data (e.g. containment search with "schema:containsPlace" etc.) or
            custom matching on date fields (e.g. services supporting the [EDTF](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/) specification
            could use "EDTF:Level-0" etc.)
            To allow discovery of supported qualifiers by clients, services that support
            match_qualifier MUST return the supported match_qualifiers for each property
            in their property suggest responses

            an optional type identifier. Supplying such a type allows users to restrict
            the search to entities which bear this type. Whether this restriction should be
            a hard constraint or simply induce a change on the reconciliation scores
            can be determined by the service.
            In particular, services MAY return candidates which do not belong to
            the supplied type.
