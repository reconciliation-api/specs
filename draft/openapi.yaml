            an optional boolean indicating if a match for the property is required for an

            This can be used for general matching relations like "skos:exactMatch",
            "skos:closeMatch", etc. or for specific features like spatial matching
            with geo data (e.g. containment search with "schema:containsPlace" etc.) or
            custom matching on date fields (e.g. services supporting the [EDTF](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/) specification
            could use "EDTF:Level-0" etc.)
            To allow discovery of supported qualifiers by clients, services that support
            match_qualifier MUST return the supported match_qualifiers for each property
            in their property suggest responses
