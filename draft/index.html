        <h3>Data Matching on the Web</h3>
        <p>
          Integrating data from sources which do not share common unique identifiers often requires matching (or <emph>reconciling</emph>, <emph>merging</emph>) records which refer to the same entities.
	  The promises of the Linked Open Data movement, the ability to mix up data from different publishers expressed in a common language (such as <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>) rely on being able to identify identities across services.
	  Due to the Web's decentralized nature, there is nothing preventing a service from publishing a new <abbr title="Universal Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> for a resource or concept which is
already expressed by another URI.
        </p>
	<p>
	  Various mechanisms exist to state the equivalence between two URIs: for instance, such a correspondence can be stated with the <code>owl:sameAs</code> property [[owl-features]], or using looser notions equivalences defined in <abbr title="Simple Knowledge
Organization System">SKOS</abbr> [[skos-primer]]. But such statements must in turn be themselves findable.
          One can aggregate <code>owl:sameAs</code> statements from various sources to infer identities by transitivity, but this is a subtle art as some data sources can erroneously equate different concepts [[beek-2018]].
          After all, any quest towards building a universal identifier system which avoids duplicates is necessarily doomed.
          Data publishers use different granularities to model the world. Concepts have fluctuating boundaries across languages, cultures and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, we can determine if two database records refer to the same entity by comparing their attributes.
          For instance, two entries about cities bearing the same name, in the same country and with the same mayor are likely to refer to the same city.
          The reconciliation API that we present here makes it easier to discover such matches.
          It is a protocol that a data provider can implement, enabling its consumers to efficiently match their own data to the entities represented by the provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          By nature, reconciliation is a heuristic process. Different entities can have many identical characteristics, leading to false positives.
          The same entity can be represented in different ways by two databases, for instance by spelling names differently, leading to false negatives.
          This problem has been extensively studied and many heuristics have been proposed to tackle it [[christen-2012]].
	  The reconciliation API is agnostic about the particulars of the heuristics involved: it lets data providers choose how
	  they want to determine which of their entities are good candidates for a particular query. What it provides
	  is a web API to let users obtain these candidate entities without having to implement the underlying reconciliation heuristics
	  themselves, nor download the entire contents of the target database.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>History of the Reconciliation API</h3>
        <p>
          This API was originally designed by Metaweb as a protocol used between Freebase and Gridworks (now known as OpenRefine).
	  Freebase was a free crowdsourced knowledge graph, storing data about a broad range of topics and exposed on the web as linked data.
	  OpenRefine is tool which was originally designed to help populate this knowledge graph by importing data into it.
	  It supports a range of operations which help the user reshape their data to prepare it for ingestion in a data model such as Freebase's.
	  One of these operations is <emph>reconciliation</emph>, which matches mentions of entities in the local dataset to records in the target database. The reconciliation API was initially introduced to specify how OpenRefine and Freebase could communicate during that process. 
        </p>
	<p>
	  The reconciliation API was then turned into a generic protocol that any database could implement.
	  This made it possible to register such a database into OpenRefine by adding it as a <emph>Standard Service</emph>.
	  This API was implemented by various services, either directly by the service provider itself (for instance the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/labs/fundref-reconciliation-service/">Crossref funder database</a>,
	  <a href="http://numishare.blogspot.com/2017/10/nomisma-launches-openrefine.html">Nomisma</a> or the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/obtain/openrefine.html">Getty thesaurus</a>) or by a third party as a wrapper sitting on top of other existing web APIs for the service
	  (such as <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/openrefine-wikidata/">Wikidata</a> or <a href="http://refine.codefork.com/">VIAF</a>).
	  Software was also developed to expose a reconciliation endpoint out of any tabular file (<a href="http://www.okfnlabs.org/reconcile-csv/">reconcile-csv</a>) or by wrapping a SPARQL endpoint (in the <a
href="https://github.com/stkenny/grefine-rdf-extension">OpenRefine RDF extension</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
	This API was documented on OpenRefine's wiki as <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconciliation-Service-API">a living document</a> which evolved gradually, as OpenRefine improved.
	  In addition to its core feature, fetching reconciliation candidates matching a given query, services are optionally able
	  to implement additional endpoints which ease the integration of the service in OpenRefine's UI, by providing previews
	  for entities (with a Preview Service) and auto-completion for various inputs (with Suggest Services).
	  In 2018, a Data Extension Service was added, letting consumers pull data from the target database once they have reconciled
	  their records.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019 the <a href="https://w3c.org/community/reconciliation">W3C Entity Reconciliation Community Group</a> was formed,
	  with the intention of promoting and improving this API outside the strict scope of the OpenRefine project.
	  This document is an attempt to better specify this API.

      <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        This section documents the data model behind the reconciliation API.
        A reconciliation service lets users match their data against <a>entities</a>
        exposed by the service. Matching can be refined by filtering by <a>type</a>
        or <a>properties</a> with <a>property values</a>.
        The purpose of this section is to define these notions.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3 data-link-for="entities">Entities</h3>
        <p>
           An <dfn>entity</dfn> is a record in the data source exposed by the service.
           It comprises the following fields:
           <dl>
	     <dt><code>id</code></dt>
             <dd>an identifier, which is a non-empty string. This identifier must be unique among all entities;</dd>
             <dt><code>name</code></dt>
             <dd>a <emph>name</emph>, which is also a non-empty string;</dd>
             <dt><code>description</code></dt>
             <dd>an optional <emph>description</emph> as a human-readable string;</dd>
             <dt><code>type</code></dt>
             <dd>an array of <a>types</a>, possibly empty;</dd>
           </dl>
           Moreover, for each <a>property</a> it contains a set of associated <a>property values</a>, possibly empty.
        </p>
        <p>
           Reconciliation services can define in their <a>service manifest</a> a <dfn>URI template</dfn> for entities,
           as defined by [[RFC6570]]. This URI template builds a view URI for each entity, and has <code>id</code> as only variable.
           For each entity, expanding the template with <code>id</code> being set to the entity's identifier
           MUST result in a valid URI.
        </p>
        <p>
           For example, a service which uses Wikidata identifiers for its entities could use <code>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/{id}</code>
           as URI template for entities. For an entity with identifier <code>Q5</code>, this would expand to <code>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5</code>.
           Services for which the entity's identifier is already a full URI can use the <code>{+id}</code> template, which disables the escaping of some characters
           when inserting the identifier in the template.
           See [[RFC6570]] for more examples of URI templates.   
        </p>
        <p>
           Similarly, it is possible to associate to each <a>matching feature</a> a URL where documentation about
           the feature is provided, by means of a URI template. Inserting any feature identifier in this template
           generates the URL for the feature.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 data-link-for="types">Types</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>type</dfn> represents a category of <a>entities</a>.
          It comprises the following fields:
          <dl>
             <dt><code>id</code></dt>
             <dd>an identifier, which is a non-empty string. This identifier must be unique among all types;</dd>
             <dt><code>name</code></dt>
             <dd>a human-readable name, which is a non-empty string;</dd>
             <dt><code>broader</code></dt>
             <dd>an optional array of <a>types</a>, each representing a direct (i.e., immediate) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#semantic-relations">broader</a> [[skos-reference]] category of <a>entities</a>.</dd>
          </dl>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 data-link-for="properties">Properties</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>property</dfn> represents a type of attribute that entities can have in the data source.
          It comprises the following fields:
          <dl>
	    <dt><code>id</code></dt>
            <dd>an identifier, which is a non-empty string. This identifier must be unique among all properties;</dd>
	    <dt><code>name</code></dt>
            <dd>a human-readable name, which is a non-empty string.</dd>
          </dl>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 data-link-for="property values">Property Values</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>property value</dfn> can be any of the following:
          <ul>
             <li>A string;</li>
             <li>A boolean;</li>
             <li>An integer;</li>
             <li>A floating-point value;</li>
             <li>An <a>entity</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 data-link-for="spaces">Identifier and Schema Spaces</h3>
        <p>
          A reconciliation service MUST define two URIs, exposed in its <a>service manifest</a>:
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn>identifier space</dfn></dt>
            <dd>The URI namespace (i.e. prefix) for the identifiers of an <a>entity</a> returned by the reconciliation service, for example <code>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/</code> or <code>https://d-nb.info/gnd/</code>. This URI MAY resolve to a page describing these entities and their identifiers;</dd>
            <dt><dfn>schema space</dfn></dt>
            <dd>A URI which identifies the type of an <a>entity</a> returned by the reconciliation service, for example <code>http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept</code> or <code>https://schema.org/Thing</code>. This URI MAY resolve to a page describing this type.</dd>
          </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
          If two different reconciliation services expose the same entities and properties, then
          they SHOULD use the same identifier and schema space URIs, signalling that
          (for instance) the Data Extension service of the first one can be used on reconciliation candidates by the second one.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The notions of identifier and schema space
          have been inherited from the API's original purpose, when it was specific
          to Freebase. Their original meaning was to be understood within Freebase's
          own data model.
        </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Service Definition</h2>
      <p>
        This section documents how reconciliation services are exposed as HTTP(S) services and
        how they can announce the features of the API they implement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>endpoint</dfn> of a reconciliation service is a URL from which the reconciliation
        service is offered.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Service Manifest</h3>
        <p>
           When the reconciliation service <a>endpoint</a> is queried with a HTTP GET query without
           parameters, the <a>service manifest</a> MUST be returned.
        </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>service manifest</dfn> consists of the following fields:
        <dl>
          <dt><code>versions</code></dt>
          <dd>The array of API versions supported by the endpoint, such as <code>["0.1", "0.2"]</code>. Since this field did not exist in version 0.1, services which do not declare a <code>versions</code> field are expected to only support version 0.1.</dd>
          <dt><code>name</code></dt>
          <dd>A human-readable name for the service, generally the name of the database it exposes. In the case where multiple reconciliation services exist for the same database, it is in the interest of a service to bear a meaningful name which
will help disambiguating it from others;</dd>
          <dt><code>identifierSpace</code></dt>

        <h3>Overview of Possible Routes</h3>
        <p>
          We give here an overview of the routes that reconciliation services MUST and MAY implement. They are all relative to the root <a>endpoint</a>, which we assume here to be <code>/</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <dl>
           <dt><code>/</code></dt>
           <dd>The root endpoint, which supports the GET method and returns the service manifest. Services MUST support this route;</dd>
           <dt><code>/reconcile</code></dt>
           <dd>The route used to submit <a>reconciliation query batches</a>, with the POST method. Services MUST support this route;</dd>
           <dt><code>/suggest/entity</code></dt>
           <dd>The route used for auto-completion of entities, with the GET method. Services MAY support this route, as indicated  in their manifest;</dd>
           <dt><code>/suggest/property</code></dt>
           <dd>The route used for auto-completion of properties, with the GET method. Services MAY support this route, as indicated in their manifest;</dd>
           <dt><code>/suggest/type</code></dt>
           <dd>The route used for auto-completion of types, with the GET method. Services MAY support this route, as indicated in their manifest;</dd>
           <dt><code>/preview</code></dt>
           <dd>The route used to preview an entity, with the GET method. Services MAY support this route, depending on the presence of a <a>preview metadata</a> object in their manifest;</dd>
           <dt><code>/extend</code></dt>
           <dd>The route used to submit <a>data extension queries</a>, with the POST method. Services MAY support this route, depending on the presence of a <a>data extension metadata</a> object in their manifest;</dd>
           <dt><code>/extend/propose</code></dt>
           <dd>The route used to obtain <a>data extension property proposals</a>, with the GET method. Services MAY support this route, following what their <a>data extension metadata</a> object in their manifest indicates.</dd>
        </dl>
       </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>HTTP(S) Access</h3>
	<p>
	   In the interest of protecting the data sent as reconciliation queries, all endpoints of reconciliation
	   services SHOULD be available over HTTPS [[RFC7230]] [[SECURING-WEB]]. This does not apply to locally hosted services.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Cross-Origin Access</h3>
        <p>
           All HTTP(S) endpoints exposed by the service MUST enable access by CORS [[cors]] to enable
           web-based clients to access the service from a different domain without exposing themselves to
           untrusted third-party code.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
           Some clients might only require cross-origin access on some particular endpoints,
	   which are called directly by a web UI.
	   Since this depends on the architecture of the client, this cannot be relied upon
	   and cross-origin access MUST be implemented for all endpoints in a uniform way.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Language Selection</h3>
        <p>
           Following [[RFC9110]], services SHOULD use the <code>Accept-Language</code> header to let clients select the language in which user-facing text is returned.
           They SHOULD use the <code>Content-Language</code> in their responses to expose the language each response is returned in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of user-facing text in service responses are: the name of the service and the name of property configuration fields in the manifest, the name and description of entities, types and properties,
          the contents of the entity preview pages, and the documentation linked in the manifest.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Error Handling and Rate-limiting</h3>
        <p>
           Services SHOULD use the broad spectrum of HTTP status codes [[RFC2616]] [[RFC6585]] to
           expose errors, for instance due to malformed or too frequent queries.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
           The response body of such error responses is not specified so far.
        </p>
      </section>
      
        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p>
           Services MAY request users to provide an authentication token when making queries.
           They can do so by adding a <dfn>security scheme</dfn> to their manifest. Security schemes are defined in [[OPENAPIS]] and
           support authentication by API key, HTTP Authentication [[RFC7617]], OAuth 2 [[RFC6749]] and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-06">OpenID Connect</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
           For instance, the following security scheme indicates that basic HTTP authentication is required on this endpoint:
           <pre data-include="examples/security-scheme/valid/http_basic_auth.json" class="example json"></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
           Requiring an API key passed as a query parameter can be expressed as follows:
           <pre data-include="examples/security-scheme/valid/api_key.json" class="example json"></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
           If a security scheme is provided in the service manifest, all queries to the service MUST provide
           the corresponding credentials, except for retrieving the service manifest itself.
           When invalid authentication is supplied in any HTTP request, the service MUST return an HTTP 401 error.
        </p>

      <h2>Reconciliation Queries</h2>
      <p>
        This section specifies how clients can send reconciliation queries to services and
        how services respond to them.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Structure of a Reconciliation Query</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>reconciliation query</dfn> consists of the following fields. 
	  At least one of <code>query</code> or <code>properties</code> must be supplied, but all other
	  fields are optional.
          <dl>
	    <dt><code>query</code></dt>
            <dd>A query string, consisting of a non-empty string.
	    	By supplying such a string, a client intends to search for entities with similar
	    	names. The specifics of how this similarity is defined are determined by the service.</dd>
	    <dt><code>type</code></dt>
            <dd>A <a>type</a> identifier. Supplying such a type allows users to restrict
	    	the search to entities which bear this type. Whether this restriction should be a
	    	hard constraint or simply induce a change on the reconciliation scores can be
	    	determined by the service. In particular, services MAY return candidates which
	    	do not belong to the supplied type;</dd>
	    <dt><code>limit</code></dt>
            <dd>A limit on the number of candidates to return, which must be a positive integer;</dd>
	    <dt><code>properties</code></dt>
	    <dd>An array of objects, where each object maps a <a href='#properties'>property</a> identifier (in the <code>pid</code> field) 
        to one or more <a>property values</a> (in the <code>v</code> field). These are used to further filter the set of candidates (similar to a WHERE clause in SQL),
		by allowing clients to specify other attributes of entities that should match, beyond their name in the <code>query</code> field.
		How reconciliation services handle this further restriction ("must match all properties" or "should match some") and how it affects the score, is up to the service.
		A reconciliation service that supports properties SHOULD provide a <a>suggest service</a> for discovering these properties;</dd>
          </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>reconciliation query batch</dfn> is an array of <a>reconciliation queries</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minimal example of a <a>reconciliation query batch</a> with mandatory fields only:
          <pre data-include="examples/reconciliation-query-batch/valid/example-min.json" class="example json"></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Full example of a <a>reconciliation query batch</a> with all optional fields:
          <pre data-include="examples/reconciliation-query-batch/valid/example-full.json" class="example json"></pre>
        </p>
	<p>
	  For a single property it is possible to provide multiple values as an array. The values provided do not need
	  to have the same type. In the following example a string and a reconciled value are provided as values for the
	  same property.
	  <pre data-include="examples/reconciliation-query-batch/valid/multi-values.json" class="example json"></pre>
	</p>
        <p>

      <section>
        <h3>Reconciliation Query Responses</h3>
        <p>
	  A <dfn>reconciliation candidate</dfn> represents an <a>entity</a> as a response to a <a>reconciliation query</a>.
	  It is proposed to the client as a potential matching entity for this query. It contains the following fields:
          <dl>
	    <dt><code>id</code></dt>
	    <dd>The identifier of the candidate entity;</dd>
	    <dt><code>name</code></dt>
	    <dd>The name of the candidate entity;</dd>
	    <dt><code>description</code></dt>
	    <dd>The entity description MAY optionally be included;</dd>
	    <dt><code>type</code></dt>
	    <dd>The types of the candidate entity;</dd>
	    <dt><code>score</code></dt>
	    <dd>A numeral indicating how well this candidate entity matches the query: a higher score indicates a better match;</dt>
            <dt><code>features</code></dt>
            <dd>An optional array of <a>matching features</a>;</dd>
	    <dt><code>match</code></dt>
            <dd>A boolean matching decision, which indicates whether the service considers this candidate good enough to be chosen as a correct match.</dd>
          </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>matching feature</dfn> is a numerical or boolean value which can be used to determine how likely it is for the candidate to be the correct entity. It contains the following fields:
          <dl>
            <dt><code>id</code></dt>
            <dd>A string which identifies the feature, such as <code>"name_tfidf"</code> or <code>"pagerank"</code>. This id must be unique among all the matching features returned for a given candidate;</dd>
            <dt><code>name</code></dt>
            <dd>A human-readable name, which is a non-empty string.</dd>
            <dt><code>value</code></dt>
            <dd>The value of the feature for the candidate, which can be any boolean or numerical value.</dd>
          </dl>
         Multiple matching features are often used in combination to provide the final matching score (available
in the <code>score</code> field). By exposing individual features in their responses, services make it possible for clients
         to compute matching scores which fit their use cases better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example of a <a>reconciliation candidate</a> with all possible fields:
          <pre data-include="examples/reconciliation-candidate/valid/example.json" class="example json"></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
	  A <dfn>reconciliation result</dfn> is a set of <a>reconciliation candidates</a>. It is serialized in JSON
	  as an object containing in the field <code>candidates</code> an array of such reconciliation candidate objects. This array SHOULD be sorted by decreasing score.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>reconciliation result batch</dfn> is an array of <a>reconciliation results</a> given in the same order as in the corresponding <a>reconciliation query batch</a>.
          When serialized in JSON, it is wrapped in an object under the <code>results</code> field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full example of a <a>reconciliation result batch</a>:
          <pre data-include="examples/reconciliation-result-batch/valid/example-full.json" class="example json"></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a href="#reconciliation-result-batch-json-schema">JSON schema to validate the serialization of a reconciliation result batch</a> is available.

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Sending Reconciliation Queries to a Service</h3>
        <p>
	  The primary role of a reconciliation service is to translate <a>reconciliation query batches</a> to
	  <a>reconciliation result batches</a> over HTTP.
	</p>
	<p>
          A reconciliation service MUST support HTTP POST requests at the route <code>/reconcile</code> (relative to its <a>endpoint</a>) with
          <code>application/json</code> bodies containing a
          <a>reconciliation query batch</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight">POST /reconcile &lt;reconciliation query batch&gt;</pre>
        </p>
	<p>
	   The service returns the corresponding query batch serialized in JSON.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
	<h3>A Note on Candidate Retrieval and Scoring</h3>
	<p>
	  The way candidates are retrieved from the underlying database and scored against the query is left
	  entirely at the discretion of the service.
	  However services should retrieve and score the candidates of each query in a batch independently
	  of the other queries in the same batch, or in previous ones.
          It is also expected that reconciliation queries where <code>query</code> matches exactly the name
          of an entity in the database and with no other constraint should return at least this entity, unless
          it is hidden by many namesakes. Similarly, supplying an entity identifier as <code>query</code>
          should return the corresponding entity as a candidate, with a high score.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Deciding on a scoring method is one of the main difficulties in developing a reconciliation service.
          Services are encouraged to expose as many <a>matching features</a> as they deem useful, in particular
          features which require knowledge of global statistics on the database or other attributes. Examples include:
          <dl>
            <dt>Name matching</dt>
            <dd>Similarity metrics to compare the entity name and the query;</dd>
            <dt>Entity popularity</dt>
            <dd>Metrics which predict how likely an entity is likely to be refered to, regardless of the query supplied;</dd>
            <dt>Comparison of attributes to query properties</dt>
            <dd>Obtained using similarity metrics to compare the supplied properties and measure their discriminative power;</dd>
            <dt>Type matching</dt>
            <dd>To quantify how well any type supplied in the query corresponds to the candidate's types.</dd>
          </dl>
	  By exposing such features, services make it possible for clients to use a wide range of data matching strategies [[christen-2012]]. This also makes the global candidate scores less opaque.
	</p>
	<p class="note">
	  Many open source reconciliation services are available and these might provide some inspiration
	  concerning indexing and scoring methods when developing new services.
	  See <a href="#external-resources">External Resources</a> for some examples.

      <h2>Preview Service</h2>
      <p>
        This section specifies how reconciliation services can provide embeddable HTML previews
        of their entities, which clients can display in their user interface.
      </p>
      <section>
      <h3>Preview Metadata</h3>
      <p>Reconciliation services MAY offer a preview service by providing the <dfn>preview metadata</dfn> as an object stored in the <a>service manifest</a> under the key <code>preview</code>. It consists of the following fields, all mandatory:
        <dl>
          <dt><code>width</code></dt>
          <dd>The width in pixels of the viewport where to render an entity preview;</dd>
          <dt><code>height</code></dt>
          <dd>The height in pixels of the same viewport.</dd>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a service may expose the following <a>preview metadata</a>:
        <pre data-include="examples/preview-metadata/valid/example.json" class="example json"></pre>
      </p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h3>Preview Queries</h3>
      <p>A preview service is queried by resolving the URI template <code>/preview?id={id}</code> relative to the reconciliation endpoint, where <code>id</code> is subsituted by the <a>entity</a> identifier. The URL must resolve to an HTML document,
        which MUST be viewable in an HTML viewport whose dimensions are determined by the <a>preview metadata</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, assuming that the reconciliation API is running at <code>/api</code> and serves the example preview metadata above, the service could respond to a preview request as follows:
       <pre data-include="examples/preview-response/example.html" data-include-format="text" class="example html">
       </pre>
      </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Suggest Services</h2>
      <p>
        This section specifies how reconciliation services can provide auto-complete
        endpoints for their <a>entities</a>, <a>properties</a> and <a>types</a>.
        A reconciliation service can offer a <dfn>suggest service</dfn> for any of these three classes. For instance, a service which only exposes a single type might not want to expose a suggest service for types.
        These suggest services can be used by clients to let users select an entity, property or type manually, at various stages of their reconciliation workflows.
        Suggest services for entities, properties and types are declared independently
        in the <a>service manifest</a>.
      </p>
      <section>
      <h3>Suggest Endpoints</h3>
      <p>
        When supported, the suggest endpoints are located at the following URIs, relative to the service's root <a>endpoint</a>:
        <dl>
          <dt><code>/suggest/entity</code></dt>
          <dt><code>/suggest/property</code></dt>
          <dt><code>/suggest/type</code></dt>
        </dl>
      </p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h3>Suggest Queries</h3>
        <p>A suggest service MUST accept GET queries with the following URL-encoded parameters:
          <dl>
            <dt><code>prefix</code></dt>
            <dd>The string input by the user in the auto-suggest-enabled field;
              depending on the data users are working with, they might want to select a suggestion from all available <a>types</a>, <a>properties</a>, or even <a>entities</a>;
              to allow that, services MAY send all suggestions if the prefix is empty, and clients SHOULD provide a way to send the empty prefix;</dd>
            <dt><code>cursor</code></dt>
            <dd>An optional integer to specify the number of suggestions to skip: this can be used by clients to fetch more suggestions.</dd>
          </dl>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="suggest-responses">
        <h3>Suggest Responses</h3>
        <p>
          A response to a suggest query consists of the following fields:
          <dl>

            <dl>
              <dt><code>id</code></dt>
              <dd>The identifier of the entity, property or type suggested;</dd>

              <dd>Its corresponding human-readable name, to be displayed prominently to the user;</dd>
              <dt><code>description</code></dt>
              <dd>An optional description which can be provided to disambiguate namesakes, providing more context. This could for instance be displayed underneath the <code>name</code>;</dd>
	      <dt><code>notable</code></dt>
	      <dd>When suggesting entities only, this field can be used to supply some important types (not necessarily all types) of the suggested entity.

        <h3>General Expectations about Suggest Services</h3>
        <p>
          It is generally expected by users that an entity suggest query where <code>prefix</code> is the name of an entity should return this entity in the suggest response, unless that entity is hidden behind many other namesakes.
          Similarly, supplying an entity identifier as <code>prefix</code> should return this entity in the suggest response. 
          Analogous expectations apply for property and type suggest services.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the <code>prefix</code> name suggests, suggest services are expected to perform prefix search on their database of records, such that a suggest service can be used to provide auto-completion as users type names or identifiers in a field.

      <p>
        This section specifies how reconciliation services can let clients fetch the values
        of some <a>properties</a> on a selection of <a>entities</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A data extension service MUST support <a>data extension query requests</a>.

        <h3>Data Extension Metadata</h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>data extension metadata</dfn> is an object stored in the <a>service manifest</a> in the <code>extend</code> field. It consists of the following settings, all optional:
          <dl>
            <dt><code>propose_properties</code></dt>
            <dd>A boolean indicating if the service supports <a>data extension property proposal</a>;</dd>

          </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>data extension property setting</dfn> consists of:
          <dl>
	    <dt><code>name</code></dt>
            <dd>A name for the setting, which identifies the setting uniquely;</dd>

	    <dt><code>type</code></dt>
            <dd>A data type, which can be one of the strings <code>"number"</code>, <code>"text"</code>, <code>"checkbox"</code>, or <code>"select"</code>. This determines which type of value the property setting gis expected to store: clients SHOULD render this setting with the corresponding HTML element;</li>
	    <dt><code>default</code></dt>
	    <dd>A default value for the setting, when not provided or left untouched by the user;</dd>
	    <dt><code>help_text</code></dt>
            <dd>A help text, which describes the meaning of the field to the user. This is meant to be a short string that can be displayed alongside the corresponding form field;</dd>
	    <dt><code>choices</code></dt>
            <dd>If <code>type</code> is <code>select</code>, an array of property setting choices.</dd>

        <h3>Data Extension Property Proposals</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>data extension property proposal</dfn> service returns <a>properties</a> for a given <a>type</a> identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the reconciliation service supports data extension property proposals, it MUST support HTTP GET requests to the endpoint <code>/extend/propose</code> (relative to the reconciliation endpoint) with a <code>type</code> query string parameter
containing a type identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The service SHOULD support an optional <code>limit</code> query string parameter to control the number of proposed properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight">GET /extend/propose?type=&lt;type identifier&gt;[&amp;limit=&lt;limit&gt;]</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>data extension property proposal response</dfn> consists of:
          <dl>
            <dt><code>properties</code></dt>
            <dd>An array of proposed <a>properties</a>. These properties are suggested as fields that could be potentially fetched via data extension for entities of the type provided in the query;</dd>

        <h3>Data Extension Query Requests</h3>
        <p>
         A <dfn>data extension query request</dfn> lets clients fetch the values
         of some <a>properties</a> on a selection of <a>entities</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that a reconciliation service offers data extension MUST be announced by including a <a>data extension metadata</a> in the <code>extend</code> field of the <a>service manifest</a>.
        <p>
          A data extension service MUST support HTTP POST requests at <code>/extend</code> (relative to the reconciliation endpoint) with
          <code>application/json</code> bodies containing a <a>data extension query</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight">POST /extend &lt;data extension query&gt;</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>data extension query</dfn> consists of:
          <ul>
            <li>An array of <a>entity</a> identifiers;</li>
            <li>An array of <a>properties</a> with optional <a href="#dfn-data-extension-property-setting">settings</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Data Extension Responses</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>data extension response</dfn> consists of <a href="#data+extension+response+metadata">metadata</a>
          and <a href="#data+extension+response+rows">rows</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn id="data+extension+response+metadata">metadata</dfn> contains the <a>properties</a> used for data
          extension, as requested in the <a>data extension query</a>. If properties have <a>entities</a> as values,
          they MAY specify a <a>type</a> in the metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn id="data+extension+response+rows">rows</dfn> object contains, for each <a>entity</a> identifier in the
          <a>data extension query</a>, for each <a>property</a> identifier in the
          <a href="#data+extension+response+metadata">metadata</a>, the <a>property values</a> of that property in that entity.
          If the property values are <a>entities</a>, their identifiers are expected to be in the service's <a>identifier space</a>.
          If that is not the case, the service MUST specify in the <code>meta</code> section the endpoint of another reconciliation service whose <a>identifier space</a>
          contains the returned entities. This endpoint is specified on a column-per-column basis.
        </p>

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Reconciliation clients provide user interfaces for creating <a>reconciliation queries</a> and reviewing <a>reconciliation candidates</a>, including <a href="preview-service">preview</a>
        and <a>suggest services</a>, as well as for interacting with <a href="#data-extension-service">data extension services</a>, including <a href="#dfn-data-extension-property-proposal">property proposals</a> 
        and configuration of <a href="#dfn-data-extension-property-setting">property settings</a>. These user interfaces SHOULD be implemented ensuring [[accessibility]] for all people, whatever their hardware,
        software, language, location, or ability.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Visual rendering</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="#preview-service">preview service</a> provides HTML content to reconciliation clients. Using HTML allows services to provide non-text alternatives for text content, as well as 
          semantically rich content (structure, styled text, hyperlinks, etc). Reconciliation services SHOULD ensure [[accessibility]] of this HTML content (avoid fixed font sizes, provide alternative text for images etc).
          The service's <a>preview metadata</a> contains the suggested width and height to display the preview content. Reconciliation clients SHOULD consider adjusting these values as required for supporting accessibility features like UI scaling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except for the preview content and size, all data involved in the reconciliation and data extension process is text-based and contains no specifics about visual rendering. Reconciliation clients SHOULD ensure [[accessibility]] for this text content
          (font resizing, screen reader support etc.) based on the technology of the underlying platform, which will typically implement the details of visual text rendering and user interface customization.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Content semantics</h3>
        <p>
          The main content presented to users is provided in <a>reconciliation results</a> and <a>data extension responses</a>. Both support <code>name</code> fields for all identifiable objects, in particular
          <a>entities</a>, <a>types</a>, <a>properties</a>, and <a>matching features</a>. These SHOULD be used by reconciliation clients to provide useful labels for displaying and linking identifiable entities. 
          The structural semantics of the content provided by reconciliation services allows different presentations (as pages, tables, etc.) in reconciliation clients. Being fully text- and JSON-based, content can 
          be modified by third-party tools to enhance accessibility.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Text-processing language</h3>

        <p>All objects used in this protocol (entities, types, properties, queries, candidates, features, etc.) MAY declare an explicit <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-text-processing-vs-metadata">
        text-processing languge</a> in a <code>lang</code> field. The <code>lang</code> value MUST be a single well-formed [[BCP 47]] language tag. This text-processing languge applies to the natural language fields of the object: <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>,
        <code>query</code> (for <a>reconciliation queries</a>), <code>v</code> and <code>str</code> (for <a>property values</a>). Nested objects inherit the text-processing language of their parent, and can override it by setting their own <code>lang</code> value
        (see example below). Client and service implementors SHOULD consider the text-processing languge to ensure correct processing of natural language content.</p>

        <p>In the following example, we first set the text-processing language for a reconciliation query to <code>en</code>, which is inherited by the first property, and overridden in the second property with <code>zh-Hant</code>:</p>

        <p>
          <pre data-include="examples/reconciliation-query-batch/valid/text-processing-language.json" class="example json"></pre>
        </p>

        <p>If no explicit text-processing language is given, the metadata language (the language of the intended audience) provided first (see <a href="#service-definition">service definition</a>) is considered the default text-processing language.</p>

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Preventing Abuse</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reconciliation services SHOULD guard against too frequent requests to prevent [[DoS]] attacks (see <a href="#error-handling-and-rate-limiting">Error Handling and Rate-limiting</a>).</li>
          <li>Reconciliation services SHOULD guard against malicious code when querying their underlying data store with data from <a>reconciliation queries</a> to avoid code [[injection]].</li>
          <li>Reconciliation services SHOULD NOT parse the JSON requests sent by clients using a code execution mechanism like JavaScript's <code>eval()</code>, since requests could contain malicious code.</li>
          <li>Reconciliation clients that display data from <a href="#preview-service">preview services</a> SHOULD ensure that the data is encoded, sanitized, or isolated to prevent [[XSS]] and [[CSRF]] attacks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Other considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reconciliation services and clients MAY support user authentication (see <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>).</li>
          <li>Reconciliation features don't expose information about the underlying platform to clients or services, they don't allow clients or services to send data to the underlying platform, access other devices, device sensors, 
            a user agent's native UI, or enable clients or services to downgrade default security protections.
